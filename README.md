This project focuses on designing and developing a responsive website for Veritas Lumina University's Computer Science department. The primary goal was to create an informative and user-friendly online presence that showcases key information about the department's faculty, course offerings, and research areas. The project was built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with a strong emphasis on a clean, modern aesthetic and intuitive navigation. A key feature is the inclusion of interactive elements like expandable accordions for faculty details and a hover animation for the heading. The final outcome is a well-organized and visually appealing website that effectively serves as a central hub for prospective and current students to learn about the department's academic and research environment.
